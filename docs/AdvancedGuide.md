## The difference between the standard behavior of effects and the use of batching

Suppose we have written a basic but cheeky calculator that prints the result of the expression `a + b` to the console as soon as a new result is available:


```ts
import { signal, effect } from 'signaler-effectus';

class CheekyCalculator {
	@signal() accessor a = 0;
	@signal() accessor b = 1;

	@effect() calc() {
		const sum = this.a + this.b;

		console.log(`Sum of ${thia.a} and ${this.b} is ${sum}`);
	}

	constructor() {
		this.calc();
	}
}

const cheekyCalc = new CheekyCalculator();
// => "Sum of 0 and 1 is 1"

```

### Run effect by updating signals

As soon as we change one of the signals, the new result is output immediately:

```ts
cheekyCalc.a = 1;
// => "Sum of 1 and 1 is 2"

cheekyCalc.b = 2;
// => "Sum of 1 and 2 is 3"
```

In a sequence diagram it looks like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as user
    participant A as signal A
    participant B as signal B
    participant E as effect calc()

    U->>+E: run
    E-->>-U: "Sum of A and B is X"

    U-)+A: set A
    activate A
    A->>E: run if value is changed
    deactivate A
    activate E
    E-->>U: "Sum of A and B is X"
    deactivate E

    U-)+B: set B
    activate B
    B->>E: run if changed
    deactivate B
    activate E
    E-->>U: "Sum of A and B is X"
    deactivate E

```

### Delay effect by batching

By _batching_ we can control this behavior:

```ts
import { batch } from 'signaler-effectus';

batch(() => {
	cheekyCalc.a = 1;
	cheekyCalc.b = 2;
})
// => "Sum of 1 and 2 is 3"
```

The sequence diagram looks different here:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as user
    participant batch
    participant A as signal A
    participant B as signal B
    participant E as effect calc()

    U->>+E: run
    E-->>-U: "Sum of A and B is X"

    U->>batch: open batch
    activate batch
    U-)A: set A
    U-)B: set B
    U--xbatch: close batch
    batch->>+E: run only if A or B changed
    deactivate batch

    A--)E: A
    B--)E: B

    E-->>-U: "Sum of A and B is X"

```
