> NOTE: formerly known as `@spearwolf/signalize` this library is now in the process of renaming itself `signaler-effectus`. so when `signaler-effectus` is referred to in the following documentation, it is intentional and if `@spearwolf/signalize` is still used, it is probably deprecated and will be adapted in the future.

# signaler-effectus

The library for signals and effects on the web


## Create Signals

Signals are mutable states that can trigger effects when changed.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>A class with a signal</th>
      <th>A standalone signal</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">
        <img
          src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spearwolf/signalize/dev/docs/images/Create_Signals--A_class_with_a_signal.png"
          alt="A class with a signal"
        />
      </td>
      <td valign="top">
        <img
          src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spearwolf/signalize/dev/docs/images/Create_Signals--A_standalone_signal.png"
          alt="A standalone signal"
        />
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


## Create Effects

Effects are functions that react to changes in signals and are executed automatically.

_Without_ effects, signals are nothing more than ordinary variables.

With effects, you can easily control behavior changes in your application without having to write complex dependency or monitoring logic.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>A class with an effect</th>
      <th>A standalone effect</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">
        <img
          src="https://github.com/spearwolf/signalize/raw/dev/docs/images/Create_Effects--A_class_with_an_effect.png"
          alt=A class with an effect"
        />
      </td>
      <td valign="top">
        <img
          src="https://github.com/spearwolf/signalize/raw/dev/docs/images/Create_Effects--A_standalone_effect.png"
          alt="A standalone effect"
        />
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
