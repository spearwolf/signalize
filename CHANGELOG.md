# CHANGELOG

## `v0.8.0`

- the createEffect api was enhanced
  - `createEffect(callback, [sigA, sigB, ..])`
    - similar to react's createEffect hook, you can now (optionally) specify a dependency array. in the dependency array, you specify the signals that will execute the effect on change. the signals do not have to match the signals used in the effect callback. if such static dependencies are specified, the effect callback will no longer be executed automatically when you create the effect. it will only be executed later if at least one signal changes.
- a signal reader callback is no longer called immediately ..
  - only when the signal changes
  - the callback is no longer called as a dynamic effect
  - it only uses the original signal as a static effect dependency
- introduce the type helper `SignalFuncs<Type>` &mdash; the return value type of `createSignal()`
- the pre-compile step for jest is omitted, now ts-jest is used and jest can be called directly without any indirection ðŸ¥³

## `v0.7.0`

- the decorators are no longer included in the default export (index.js)
  - to use the decorators, the user must import them from `@spearwolf/signalize/decorators'
- fix package type definitions

## `v0.6.1`

- no _commonjs_ format is delivered anymore
- the _esm_ format is no longer bundled
- use `import type ..` syntax

## `v0.6.0`

- switch package to `type: module`
  - this hopefully solves the problem that typescript cannot resolve the types correctly when `signalize.mjs` is loaded ðŸ˜µ
  - the final package output will now completely omit `.mjs` file endings

## `v0.5.2`

- mark package as side effects free
- update (mainly dev) dependencies

## `v0.5.1`

- upgrade dev depenedencies
  - this includes an upgrade from typescript 5.1 to 5.2, which brings with it new build artefacts

## `v0.5.0`

- upgrade dependency `@spearwolf/eventize` to `v3.0.0`
- remove `type=module` from package.json
  - instead, use `*.mjs` file extension for _esm_ output
- introduce CHANGELOG ðŸ˜‰
